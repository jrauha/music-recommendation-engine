## Weekly report 2

**What I did this week:**

This week, I built upon the foundation laid out last week and focused on acquiring and preparing the data for the project. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Data exploration:**
  - Identified and researched several datasets relevant to the project's goals.
  - Analyzed the datasets to understand their structure, size, and potential challenges.
- **Data acquisition:**
  - Downloaded or accessed the chosen dataset(s).
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing:**
  - Identified and addressed any missing values or inconsistencies within the data.
  - Implemented techniques to transform the data into a format suitable for the project.

**Project progress:**

The project is progressing well and next steps are quite clear.

**Uncertainties or challenges:**

- Identifying a comprehensive music dataset that includes user listening history alongside song information. In the end following dataset was chosen: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/spotify-playlists/data

**Next steps:**

- Begin developing the core functionality of the project using the prepared data.
