## Weekly report 1: Kickoff

**What I did this week:**

This week, I focused on getting the project off the ground. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Project planning:**
  - Defined the project goals and scope.
- **Background research:**
  - Learned about the core concepts and details of the techniques.
  - Gathered information and examples of similar projects using this technique.

**Project progress:**

While I haven't started coding yet, I've made solid progress on planning and understanding the project.

**Uncertainties or challenges:**

I'm unsure about the best ways to improve the technique's performance when dealing with large datasets.

**Next steps:**

- Begin coding the core functionality and the user interface.
- Implement features to load and prepare the data.
- Develop a way to visualize the results.
